# ENPI
This is a stand-alone implementation of E&amp;N acivities server for the Raspberry Pi. 
This project is supported by the Fondation Orange who distributes it in schools in africa. [Read about this program](http://www.fondationorange.com/Le-Raspberry-Pi-coeur-des-ecoles)

We suppose you have heard about Education & Numerique and have some ideas about authoring and/or distributing digital padagogical activities in E&N context. 
[get some user experience on E&N](http://www.Education-et-Numerique.org)
[take a look at E&N's catalogue](http://catalogue.Education-et-Numerique.org)
[get some authoring experience on E&N](http://auteur.Education-et-Numerique.org)
[get the tech words on Github](https://github.com/Education-Numerique)

The ENPI implementation is based on the use of the SCORM export of E&N authoring environment.

A good starting point to get the best of this project would be :
- register as an author and make a SCORM package of an activity
- or download one here
- look at the internal MongoDB format at XXXXXXXXX
